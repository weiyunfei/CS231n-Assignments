    "Tensorflow 2.0 is still not in a fully 100% stable release, but it's still usable and more intuitive than TF 1.x. Please make sure you have it installed before moving on in this notebook! Here are some steps to get started:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Have the latest version of Anaconda installed on your machine.\n",
    "2. Create a new conda environment starting from Python 3.7. In this setup example, we'll call it `tf_20_env`.\n",
    "3. Run the command: `source activate tf_20_env`\n",
    "4. Then pip install TF 2.0 as described here: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip \n",

    "A guide on creating Anaconda enviornments: https://uoa-eresearch.github.io/eresearch-cookbook/recipe/2014/11/20/conda/\n",
    "\n",
    "This will give you an new enviornemnt to play in TF 2.0. Generally, if you plan to also use TensorFlow in your other projects, you might also want to keep a seperate Conda environment or virtualenv in Python 3.7 that has Tensorflow 1.9, so you can switch back and forth at will. "

    "# Part II: Barebones TensorFlow\n",
    "TensorFlow ships with various high-level APIs which make it very convenient to define and train neural networks; we will cover some of these constructs in Part III and Part IV of this notebook. In this section we will start by building a model with basic TensorFlow constructs to help you better understand what's going on under the hood of the higher-level APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**\"Barebones Tensorflow\" is important to understanding the building blocks of TensorFlow, but much of it involves concepts from TensorFlow 1.x.** We will be working with legacy modules such as `tf.Variable`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, please read and understand the differences between legacy (1.x) TF and the new (2.0) TF.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Historical background on TensorFlow 1.x\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow 1.x is primarily a framework for working with **static computational graphs**. Nodes in the computational graph are Tensors which will hold n-dimensional arrays when the graph is run; edges in the graph represent functions that will operate on Tensors when the graph is run to actually perform useful computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before Tensorflow 2.0, we had to configure the graph into two phases. There are plenty of tutorials online that explain this two-step process. The process generally looks like the following for TF 1.x:\n",
    "1. **Build a computational graph that describes the computation that you want to perform**. This stage doesn't actually perform any computation; it just builds up a symbolic representation of your computation. This stage will typically define one or more `placeholder` objects that represent inputs to the computational graph.\n",
    "2. **Run the computational graph many times.** Each time the graph is run (e.g. for one gradient descent step) you will specify which parts of the graph you want to compute, and pass a `feed_dict` dictionary that will give concrete values to any `placeholder`s in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The new paradigm in Tensorflow 2.0\n",
    "Now, with Tensorflow 2.0, we can simply adopt a functional form that is more Pythonic and similar in spirit to PyTorch and direct Numpy operation. Instead of the 2-step paradigm with computation graphs, making it (among other things) easier to debug TF code. You can read more details at https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/eager.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between the TF 1.x and 2.0 approach is that the 2.0 approach doesn't make use of `tf.Session`, `tf.run`, `placeholder`, `feed_dict`. To get more details of what's different between the two version and how to convert between the two, check out the official migration guide: https://www.tensorflow.org/alpha/guide/migration_guide\n",

    "### TensorFlow warmup: Flatten Function\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see this in action by defining a simple `flatten` function that will reshape image data for use in a fully-connected network.\n",
    "\n",
    "In TensorFlow, data for convolutional feature maps is typically stored in a Tensor of shape N x H x W x C where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- N is the number of datapoints (minibatch size)\n",
    "- H is the height of the feature map\n",
    "- W is the width of the feature map\n",
    "- C is the number of channels in the feature map\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the right way to represent the data when we are doing something like a 2D convolution, that needs spatial understanding of where the intermediate features are relative to each other. When we use fully connected affine layers to process the image, however, we want each datapoint to be represented by a single vector -- it's no longer useful to segregate the different channels, rows, and columns of the data. So, we use a \"flatten\" operation to collapse the `H x W x C` values per representation into a single long vector. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice the `tf.reshape` call has the target shape as `(N, -1)`, meaning it will reshape/keep the first dimension to be N, and then infer as necessary what the second dimension is in the output, so we can collapse the remaining dimensions from the input properly.\n",
    "\n",

    "# Part III: Keras Model Subclassing API\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing a neural network using the low-level TensorFlow API is a good way to understand how TensorFlow works, but it's a little inconvenient - we had to manually keep track of all Tensors holding learnable parameters. This was fine for a small network, but could quickly become unweildy for a large complex model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately TensorFlow 2.0 provides higher-level APIs such as `tf.keras` which make it easy to build models out of modular, object-oriented layers. Further, TensorFlow 2.0 uses eager execution that evaluates operations immediately, without explicitly constructing any computational graphs. This makes it easy to write and debug models, and reduces the boilerplate code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part of the notebook we will define neural network models using the `tf.keras.Model` API. To implement your own model, you need to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define a new class which subclasses `tf.keras.Model`. Give your class an intuitive name that describes it, like `TwoLayerFC` or `ThreeLayerConvNet`.\n",
    "2. In the initializer `__init__()` for your new class, define all the layers you need as class attributes. The `tf.keras.layers` package provides many common neural-network layers, like `tf.keras.layers.Dense` for fully-connected layers and `tf.keras.layers.Conv2D` for convolutional layers. Under the hood, these layers will construct `Variable` Tensors for any learnable parameters. **Warning**: Don't forget to call `super(YourModelName, self).__init__()` as the first line in your initializer!\n",
    "3. Implement the `call()` method for your class; this implements the forward pass of your model, and defines the *connectivity* of your network. Layers defined in `__init__()` implement `__call__()` so they can be used as function objects that transform input Tensors into output Tensors. Don't define any new layers in `call()`; any layers you want to use in the forward pass should be defined in `__init__()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you define your `tf.keras.Model` subclass, you can instantiate it and use it like the model functions from Part II.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Keras Model Subclassing API: Two-Layer Network\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a concrete example of using the `tf.keras.Model` API to define a two-layer network. There are a few new bits of API to be aware of here:\n",
    "\n",
    "We use an `Initializer` object to set up the initial values of the learnable parameters of the layers; in particular `tf.initializers.VarianceScaling` gives behavior similar to the Kaiming initialization method we used in Part II. You can read more about it here: https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/initializers/VarianceScaling\n",
    "\n",
    "We construct `tf.keras.layers.Dense` objects to represent the two fully-connected layers of the model. In addition to multiplying their input by a weight matrix and adding a bias vector, these layer can also apply a nonlinearity for you. For the first layer we specify a ReLU activation function by passing `activation='relu'` to the constructor; the second layer uses softmax activation function. Finally, we use `tf.keras.layers.Flatten` to flatten the output from the previous fully-connected layer."

    "- If the parameters are working well, you should see improvement within a few hundred iterations\n",
    "- Remember the coarse-to-fine approach for hyperparameter tuning: start by testing a large range of hyperparameters for just a few training iterations to find the combinations of parameters that are working at all.\n",
    "- Once you have found some sets of parameters that seem to work, search more finely around these parameters. You may need to train for more epochs.\n",
    "- You should use the validation set for hyperparameter search, and save your test set for evaluating your architecture on the best parameters as selected by the validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Going above and beyond\n",
    "If you are feeling adventurous there are many other features you can implement to try and improve your performance. You are **not required** to implement any of these, but don't miss the fun if you have time!\n",
    "\n",
    "- Alternative optimizers: you can try Adam, Adagrad, RMSprop, etc.\n",
    "- Alternative activation functions such as leaky ReLU, parametric ReLU, ELU, or MaxOut.\n",
    "- Model ensembles\n",
    "- Data augmentation\n",
    "- New Architectures\n",
    "  - [ResNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) where the input from the previous layer is added to the output.\n",
    "  - [DenseNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993) where inputs into previous layers are concatenated together.\n",
